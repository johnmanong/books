# From Good to Great
#### 6/27/2017 - 9/14/2017
Lots of companies are good, very few make the transision to great. Research focuses on companies with long history of good (~15yrs) and a transition to great with sustained results (~15yrs). Normalizes for industry performance, unsustained performance. Takes very intentional effort, but is not more work/pain than remaining mediocre. A lot of work/energy spent on efforts that do not drive great results; these are a waste. Summary of framework on p. 12 and below.

Buildup
- Level 5 leadership
- First who...then what
- Confront the brutal facts, yet never lose faith (Stockdale paradox)

Breakthrough

  - What can we be best in the world at, that drives our economic engine, that we are passionate about?
- culture of discipline
- technology accelorators

Also, every two grouped by three phases of discipline: people, thought, action. Flywheel needs momentum to get started, but once it's going it can sustain and drive great results.

# A Sense of Urgency
#### Early 2017 or end of 2016
Innovation starts with urgency. Complacency and false urgency (lots of activity on low or negative impact activities) will kill inovation. True urgency means people are focusing solving critically important problems now, saying no along the way.

Four tactics outlined in the book:
  1 - bring the outside in
  2 - behave with urgency every day (yes, you)
  3 - find opportunity in crisis
  4 - deal with NoNos (skilled urgency killer, "everythings fine")

Urgency takes sustained effort.
