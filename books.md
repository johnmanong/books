# A Sense of Urgency
#### Early 2017 or end of 2016
Innovation starts with urgency. Complacency and false urgency (lots of activity on low or negative impact activities) will kill inovation. True urgency means people are focusing solving critically important problems now, saying no along the way.

Four tactics outlined in the book:
  1 - bring the outside in
  2 - behave with urgency every day (yes, you)
  3 - find opportunity in crisis
  4 - deal with NoNos (skilled urgency killer, "everythings fine")
